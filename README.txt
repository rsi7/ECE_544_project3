Project 3 Release
ECE 544 Embedded - Winter 2016
-------------------------------

NOTE:  This is a FULL RELEASE FOR Project #3.  The documentation and starter application have been updated for the Nexys 4 board and I have successfully built the system and executed my full application on a Nexys4 board. I have not brought up the system and application on a Nexys4 DDR board but since we are not using external memory the application should run. 

This starter package contains a suggested template for implementing Project #3.  The starter application does not do anything on its own.

You need to breathe life into it with your additions.  The starter package, which also includes platform*.* is based on the xilkernel 
application
template created by SDK when you build a new C/C++ project.
